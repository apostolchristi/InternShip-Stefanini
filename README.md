PART 1
1.	Write a program that reads an integer and prints it in binary, octal and hexadecimal format.
2.	Write a program that reads an integer angle (which may be positive or negative) and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. (Hint: try to use % then try with Math.floorMod )
3.	Using conditional operator, write a program that reads three integers and prints the largest. Reapeat with Math.max.
4.	Write a program that computes the factorial N! = 1x2x…… xN using BigInteger. Compute the factorial of 1000.
5.	Write a program that reads a string and prints all of its nonempty substrings (empty substring “_”).
6.	Write a program that produces a random string of letters and digits by generating a random long value and printing it in base 36.
7.	Write a program that reads a line of text and prints all characters that are not ASCII, together with their Unicode values.
8.	Write a program that swap the content of two IntHolder.
9.	Implement an immutable class Point that describe a point in the plane. Provide the constructor to set it to a specific point, a no-arg constructor to set it to the origin, and methods getX, getY, translate and scale. The translate method scales both coordinates by a given factor. Implement these methods so that they return new points with the results. For ex:
Point p = new Point(3, 4).translate(1, 3).scale(0.5);
10.	Repeat the preceding exercise, but now make translate and scale into mutators.
11.	 Provides an interface Measurable with a method double getMeasure() that measure an object in some way. Make Employee implement Measurable. Provide a method: double average(Measurable[] objects) that computes the average measure. Use it to compute the average salary of an array of employees.
12.	Continue with the preceding exercise and provide a method Measurable largest(Measurable[] objects). Use it to find the name of the employee with the largest salary.
13.	Given an array of File objects, sort it so that directories come before files, and within each group, elements are sorted by path name. Use the lambda expression to specify the Comparator.
14.	Define a class Point with a constructor public Point(double x, double y) and accessor methods getX, getY. Define a subclass LabelPoint with a constructor public LabeledPoint(String label, double x, double y) and an accessor method getLabel.
15.	Define (override) toString, equals, and hashCode methods for the previews exercise.
